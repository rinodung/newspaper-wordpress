You can even embed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\">plugin</a> has been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/\">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

If you&#8217;ve already been using a plugin to implement term metadata, you should read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/\">this post</a> on how to prepare. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162\">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/\">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

The video was recorded Tuesday, November 24 and published over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg offers a hands-on tour of the new reader, notifications, and editor and explains WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture for audience members who are not development-oriented. He also explains how the desktop client and browser version were developed simultaneously so that WordPress.com can continue to iterate just as quickly as it has in the past, with developers committing new code 140+ times per day.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t get enough of WordPress vs. Medium comparisons, then this episode is for you. When asked if he sees Medium as a competitor to WordPress, Mullenweg replied, &#8220;In some ways we compete with every place that people publish online, even Twitter or Facebook, but in day to day, that competition doesn&#8217;t really drive product decisions and for most people what we provide is pretty distinct from what these other platforms have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Later in the episode Mullenweg is asked, &#8220;What are the holes still left unfilled in publishing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Publishing is still so mediocre,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Some of the best stuff Medium did is around their editor. I think the whole writing/collaboration experience can be significantly better than it is today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg elaborates on the differences between WordPress.com and Medium&#8217;s user base and his vision for where Automattic will take Calypso in the future.

One of the event&#8217;s highlights is Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word presentation. In it, Mullenweg shares data on WordPress&#8217; growth throughout the year and gives insight to where the project is heading.</p>\n<p>About a week before his presentation, Mullenweg asks members of the WordPress community for feedback. Questions include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the things you&#8217;re most proud of WordPress or people in the community doing over the past year?</li>\n<li>Have there been people who you feel have influenced the project in a big way, including yourself, and how?</li>\n<li>What do you think we should focus on and work on the most in the next year?</li>\n<li>Any stories you&#8217;ve heard with or around WordPress that you think deserve being highlighted?</li>\n<li>Anything else?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This year, the most important question he asks is number five. Each year during the State of the Word, Mullenweg highlights new and existing contributors and we as a community cheer and celebrate them. This year, we&#8217;ve lost some incredibly talented and important people in the community.</p>\n<p>I suggest that Mullenweg adds one slide to his presentation that remembers the lives of those lost in the community this year. The slide should have Gravatars or photos and the names of those who passed away. Here are a few people who would be on the slide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\">Kim Parsell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away\">Alex King</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattreport.com/honoring-clint-warren/\">Clint Warren</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordcampmiami/status/561953493360336896\">Jacqueline Jiminez</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in favor of this idea and know someone in the WordPress community who passed away this year, please leave a comment with their name and if possible, a link to their obituary.</p>\n<p>WordPress is a 12-year-old open source software project that will likely survive long after the people who help maintain it pass on. Adding a slide to the State of the Word that remembers contributors who passed away during the year is a small price to pay. It also humanizes the software and serves as a reminder that without contributors, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 20:22:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Early Reviews Show Applications Like Calypso Are the Future of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=49161\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6086:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/calypso.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49205\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/calypso.png?resize=900%2C475\" alt=\"calypso\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49205\" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic unveiled Project Calypso</a>, a brand new architecture for WordPress.com and a <a href=\"https://desktop.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mac app</a> that mirrors the experience on desktop. The overhaul was nearly two years in the making, a risky bet for Automattic but one that shows a glimpse of what the future of WordPress could be.</p>\n<p>The new JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress.com technologically pivots the platform into a lithe modern publishing engine while shedding 10 years of legacy code in the process. It&#8217;s easy to see why Calypso has so far received <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/\" target=\"_blank\">glowing reviews</a> from news outlets around the web. The <a href=\"https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/whats-new-wpcom2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">giant technological leap forward</a> results in a publishing experience that is a night-and-day difference when it comes to page loads, content previewing, and real-time updating.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/24/wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg-breaks-down-the-blogging-platforms-biggest-overhaul-in-years/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with VentureBeat</a>, Matt Mullenweg answers a burning question that the community wants to know &#8211; <em>What does Calypso mean for WordPress core?</em> Will core adopt a similar technology stack? Mullenweg sees Calypso as just one example of what is possible with WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I think what might happen is that the technology that drives the server side of WordPress and what drives the client side can diverge. Again, this is really up to the community, so we’ll see where it takes us. This thing we released has only been out there one day. Maybe someone will make something much better?</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture isn&#8217;t the first case of &#8220;headless WordPress,&#8221; though it is one of the most prominent and easiest examples for users to demo. Many other WordPress-powered sites have already adopted an approach that decouples the interface using the new WP REST API. Apps like <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/\" target=\"_blank\">StoryCorps</a>, <a href=\"http://nomadbase.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomadbase</a>, the New York Times, and the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/09/apple-liveblog-iphone-apple-tv-news/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired.com liveblog</a> are a few early pioneers using the API to deliver content.</p>\n<p>Another example offered in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-story-behind-the-new-wordpress-com/#comment-7275\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the WordPress.com developer blog cites <a href=\"https://ustwo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ustwo.com</a> (the makers of Monument Valley, Dice, and other popular apps) as using a similar setup. The site is a <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\">React.js</a> single-page application that serves WordPress content via the WP REST API using custom endpoints. Like WordPress.com, the code for this site is also <a href=\"https://github.com/ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend\" target=\"_blank\">open source on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite the risk of sharing the large innovative codebase with competitors, Automattic opted to keep Calypso open and available for anyone in the WordPress community to learn from and build upon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back,&#8221; Mullenweg said in his <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>Within the first 24 hours the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\" target=\"_blank\">repo</a> was already <a href=\"https://github.com/trending\" target=\"_blank\">trending on GitHub</a>, with developers eagerly reviewing the code. ManageWP, a competitor to Jetpack Manage, <a href=\"https://managewp.com/will-calypso-change-game\" target=\"_blank\">praised Calypso</a> as an important tool to help drive up WordPress marketshare and move the platform forward:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That’s the beauty of WordPress – the Foundation is not looking to put us under Automattic’s thumb; Matt and his team are actively encouraging the WordPress community, through open source policy, to keep building, innovating, making lives easier for everyone, and find their own place in the ecosystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s commitment to open sourcing its code demonstrates that any innovations they release are not designed to eclipse competitors&#8217; efforts but rather to add to the shared knowledge bank that drives WordPress improvements.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, in a <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/\" target=\"_blank\">roundup of press on Calypso</a>, brings it back to the core value of democratizing publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it’s not about technology for technology’s sake, it’s about technology at the service of human voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Calypso is one of the best new examples of having WordPress your way. It demonstrates the flexibility of using a REST API to run any kind of JavaScript application on top of WordPress while maintaining the use of its world class CMS features. Greater architectural freedom for developers means more compelling publishing experiences for users. The success of the open source Calypso project will likely pave the way for many more JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress sites and desktop applications.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:29:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugin Replaces Hello Dolly Lyrics With Random Quotes From Star Wars Characters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=49194\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-replaces-hello-dolly-lyrics-with-random-quotes-from-star-wars-characters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1848:\"<p>On <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/releaseinfo\">December 18th</a>, fans across the U.S. will flock to movie theaters to watch <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>.

Lema shares his experience beta testing a Windows version of Automattic&#8217;s new desktop application. We discuss how WordPress is going to grow its market share from 25% to 50% and how important Jetpack is to reaching that goal.

It allows you to identify your users and keep track of their activities in an easy to read digital dashboard and log format.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-timeline/\">Cool Timeline</a> is Narinder Singh&#8217;s first plugin in the repository.

I’m struggling with my health and maintaining a schedule as a distributed worker. A dear WordPress friend of mine (Kim Parsell) passed away at the beginning of the year. My grandma was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and I’ve been dealing with wild swings between feeling positive and downright depressed.</p>\n<p>The thing I’m most thankful for this year as it relates to WordPress are the people who make up the community. Some are personal friends, others live on the other side of the world. Their consistent reinforcement of positive vibes has helped me get through some turbulent times in my life this year. To everyone who has and continues to give me encouragement, advice, and positive reinforcement, thank you.</p>\n<h2>What Marcus is Thankful For:</h2>\n<p>This year was one of the hardest years for me in terms of professional struggles and hardships. I lost relatives and friends, a job, and had to start from square one. I had a lot of support from within the WordPress community coming really close to working with a few people directly. In the end, it was my WordPress skills that landed me a new gig, which I now call <em>The Dream Gig</em>.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful for the opportunities to meet people from within the WordPress community in real life. From Chris Lema and Cory Miller to Jeff Chandler and beyond. Every time I meet someone, they not only share their successes, but their struggles. It’s good to know that I’m not the only one and be able to use their strength and perseverance to fuel my drive and passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful for the opportunity to share what I know to thousands of people around the world. I feel the best sense of accomplishment when I receive an email from someone that&#8217;s stuck on a particular problem and discovers a solution after they hear me talk about a plugin or technique on a podcast. It’s a great outlet for me personally that I hope to continue for many more years to come. Thanks to all who are listening and to those who are listening for the first time.</p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, December 2nd 9:30 P.M.

If you like the show, I&#8217;d highly appreciate if you share it with your friends and colleagues.</p>\n<h3>Why did you make such a big bet on Calypso?</h3>\n<p>Matt has talked for a while now about his vision that WordPress can become an &#8220;app platform,&#8221; and this is an example of what that meant to him.</p>\n<p>He also notes how he&#8217;s always  looking for things that will &#8220;move the needle&#8221; for greater WordPress adoption. We were both thinking about the same statistic: that <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/2013-state-of-the-word-from-matt-mullenweg/\">roughly 96% of WordPress.com users</a> (and probably a high number of WordPress.org users too) essentially abandon their websites after a short tenure. So anything that can increase that number, to say 8% or 15% of folks that stick with it long term, can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h3>How do you think about investing in feature development for WordPress.com, and how it affects WordPress as well?</h3>\n<p>When Matt considers where he wants to invest Automattic developer and designer time, he says he thinks of WordPress as a whole first, before considering specifics for WordPress.com. He&#8217;d rather see WordPress.com as a gateway to a self-hosted install. And whether someone stays on .com or moves to a self-hosted install, he wants to help ensure that their problems are solved.</p>\n<h3>WordPresses</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s new to me, but Matt says he&#8217;s been saying it for years, that he calls WordPress websites &#8220;WordPresses,&#8221; after a long time internal debate about whether to call WordPress.com websites sites or blogs.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com as a network versus a platform</h3>\n<p>The new homepage for logged in users, or users in the WordPress.com app, defaults to the Reader view of the interface, versus the writing view. This intrigued me, as I don&#8217;t personally think of WordPress.com as a read-first ecosystem, but rather a place to write. I think more of Tumblr or Medium when I think of a destination for reading, where I may also write.</p>\n<p>Matt and I talked about the merits of WordPress as a network versus a platform. He thinks it can be both. And I think this touches on one of the big goals for Calypso that we haven&#8217;t discussed yet: to make WordPress a better network.</p>\n<p>To me, WordPress.com is a platform, but WordPress (both .com and Jetpack enabled sites) are ripe to be a hugely successful network, through the huge number of websites and independent publishers that are interconnected via WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>There is more evidence that this is a goal for them too, with the <a href=\"https://discover.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/hello-world/\">launch of Discover WordPress</a> along with the release of the new interface. Discover WordPress is a project by the editorial team to surface the best writing across WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, beyond the human curated content, much could be done in the future algorithmically. We didn&#8217;t get as much into this stuff as I would&#8217;ve liked, but I think it&#8217;s  an enormous growth area for Automattic.</p>\n<h3>Open sourcing Calypso</h3>\n<p>The Calypso <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\">project code</a> is fully open source, and is a top trending project on Github right now. There are few requirements to run the code locally, so you can pretty quickly get a working web view.</p>\n<p>There are a slew of <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components\">fancy React components</a> that could be pretty easily lifted from Calypso and used independently, as well as a <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/guide/hello-world.md\">guide to getting started</a> with the full codebase.</p>\n<h3>How can the community anticipate the future, with more abstracted implementations of WordPress?</h3>\n<p>As WordPress projects continue to use REST APIs to create fully custom frontends, backends, and inbetweens, I was curious what Matt thinks the community can do to anticipate and educate users on how to deal with these scenarios, that may fragment WordPress and be confusing for people who expect WordPress plugins and code to interact well with one another.</p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a problem, but says it&#8217;s important that we experiment and learn from our experiments; he was hesitant to call the potential for confusion fragmentation as much as experimentation. Either way, I do think education and documentation will be important as other folks continue to use parts of WordPress to make impressive things, without supporting every specific thing that can <em>also</em> run on WordPress.</p>\n<p>An example of this is the WordPress.com app itself. You can manage Jetpack enabled sites through it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you get everything in the editor you&#8217;d get with a WordPress.org site, like custom fields and other plugin functionality that the desktop app doesn&#8217;t support.</p>\n<h3>What is Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor?</h3>\n<p>I wanted to know what Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor is, in Matt&#8217;s mind. He defaulted, I guess unsurprisingly, to &#8220;everything,&#8221; but as I pushed him a little further, he dug a bit more into some of the things that make Automattic interesting.</p>\n<p>From a self-hosted perspective, WordPress.com integrated tools like Stats, VaultPress, and Akismet are difficult to match with other tools.</p>\n<p>For WordPress.com, he thinks the potential power of the Reader and network can be compelling. I agree there that the diversity of the WordPress.com and Jetpack author audience could make for a compelling Reading product, that has more potential than I see right now in a competitor like Medium, which is quite tech heavy.</p>\n<p>Matt says, <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve built up a lot of trust in the community, and that goodwill definitely pays back.&#8221;</span> Part of what makes it hard to identify Automattic&#8217;s specific differentiator is that they do a lot of things. Matt acknowledged this, but counters by saying that they work hard on user experience and being a good community citizen.</p>\n<h3>How have teams changed at Automattic over time?</h3>\n<p>Automattic scales by splitting teams when they get too big. Today, there are 46 teams. Some of those teams are embedded in larger teams and have some hierarchy, but the company is still quite flat for a company of 400 people.</p>\n<p>The rule of thumb Matt wants to maintain is that someone should have no more than 10 people that report directly to them, though he has around 23.</p>\n<p>According to the standards of the tech world, Automattic&#8217;s scale in terms of the number of employees may be somewhat ordinary, but they have still had massive and consistent change over the decade of the company&#8217;s existence. And they are hiring as fast as they can to this day.</p>\n<h3>The challenge of customizing WordPress sites</h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago, someone from Automattic told me how concerned they were about the WordPress customizer&#8217;s ability to scale, both for use on mobile devices, and as a utility that could manage a lot of features. And I wanted to know how Matt thinks that has evolved, now that the customizer is in such significant use on both WordPress.com and for self-hosted websites.</p>\n<p>As he notes, the customizer has undergone a lot of positive iteration over the last several releases, and today the WordPress.com and WordPress.org customizers are using the same base code; whereas for a while WordPress.com had their own custom implementation.</p>\n<p>But he still says that, &#8220;If we&#8217;re candid with ourselves, &#8230; customization is still the worst part of WordPress, you know? It&#8217;s the hardest. It&#8217;s where people get stuck. It&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a real gap between the promise and what people are able to realize and create when they get started using WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as much a problem with the use of themes, or if you can code, but for new users, &#8220;it&#8217;s their biggest struggle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One idea that I have is to have a more Medium-like interface be the &#8220;default&#8221; view, versus a changing default theme. That way, WordPress.com could be more opinionated about the default view, and change the theme at will, or along with trends, versus giving new users the default theme of a particular year and then that theme is untouched unless the user decides to switch.</p>\n<p>Matt said they have that a bit on the Reader view, but that is what someone in the WordPress.com network would see, versus what an outside website visitor would see.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there are definitely challenges ahead for enabling customizations and, more importantly, just ensuring sites look good for users. I think that this is an area where other platforms &#8212; like Medium and Squarespace, though in different ways &#8212; are doing a good job.</p>\n<h3>The first line of the Automattic creed</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/\">Automattic creed</a> states at the very beginning, &#8220;I will never stop learning.&#8221; That was part of Matt&#8217;s response when I asked just how they managed to <a href=\"http://dentedreality.com.au/2015/11/23/all-new-wordpress-com/\">cross-train a workforce</a> that was primarily made of PHP developers to create a world-class JavaScript driven application.</p>\n<p>Additionally to the natural desires that Automattic employees should have to learn, they created internal resources for helping people, and are considering releasing some of that material, maybe in the form of webinars or an online conference.</p>\n<p>Matt said Automatticians will also be sharing what they learn at other conferences, like the upcoming <a href=\"https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/\">A Day of REST</a>, where two Automatticians will be speaking.</p>\n<p>Matt did admit that he hasn&#8217;t made the PHP to JavaScript switch yet, and personally feels more comfortable in PHP; though some of his team have said it wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as it sounds.</p>\n<h3>Bug bounties</h3>\n<p>Did you know all Automattic properties are on <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/automattic\">Hacker One</a>, the bug bounty community? If you find a security bug, you can get a bounty if you report it. I didn&#8217;t know this until the Calypso launch.</p>\n<h3>How is Automattic thinking about revenue?</h3>\n<p>With my napkin math and a few small things I know about Automattic, I&#8217;d guesstimate they are somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in annual revenue. I didn&#8217;t even attempt to get confirmation of this, because I know they don&#8217;t reveal this kind of information. So instead I wanted to get more insights of how Matt thinks about revenue at Automattic.</p>\n<p>Generally, he says they put their focus in, &#8220;three main buckets.&#8221; They use that focus both for revenue purposes and product purposes. Those areas are WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>They group things like VaultPress and Akismet under Jetpack; so it&#8217;s basically their WordPress.org SaaS revenue stream. Those are paid subscription products.  They have been transitioning that offering, as Matt shared, &#8220;a big trend over the past few years, has been to move away from a la carte upgrades, and have more bundles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve discovered that bundled plans of $100 per year and $300 per year have been successful. Here are those plans, for both WordPress.com and WordPress.org, as shown in the new WordPress.com/Calypso interface:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15013\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wp-org-plan.png\" alt=\"wp-org-plan\" width=\"739\" height=\"693\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15014\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wpcom-plan.png\" alt=\"wpcom-plan\" width=\"736\" height=\"798\" /></p>\n<p>It appears they get most of their revenue from this stream. I do know, and have previously reported, that at least at one point, WordPress.com VIP accounted for upwards of 25% of overall revenue, and though that gross number has gone up over the years, its percentage of overall revenue has gone down, meaning that these paid plans have outpaced VIP, growth-wise. I&#8217;d guess VIP revenue is now less than half of that 25% number now, but can&#8217;t confirm it.</p>\n<h3>Total sites, versus engagement</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of WordPress.com websites, but as Matt noted, it&#8217;s a vanity metric due to the fact that such a small percentage are active, engaged users. So they are trying more to track engagement versus total sites.</p>\n<p>I tried to get him to share the number of active websites, but that&#8217;s not something he could share.</p>\n<h3>Helping site owners monetize, and WooCommerce integration to WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I talked about the roadmap some, and asked Matt about what they may offer in the future to help authors monetize their sites. They currently have a <a href=\"https://wordads.co/\">WordAds</a> program, but that is a pageview driven strategy, and I&#8217;d love to see them introduce a way for authors to get paid via a tip jar, private paid posts, or subscription system like I&#8217;ve heard Medium is investigating. It&#8217;s not on their current roadmap, but he says he&#8217;d be open to it.</p>\n<p>He also noted that since WooCommerce is now &#8220;part of the family,&#8221; that there may be future monetization opportunities through that, though he said they don&#8217;t have current plans for a hosted version of WooCommerce on WordPress.com. I was honestly pretty surprised by this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the beginning, our focus is really going to be on people hosting their stores, you know, with web hosts. Because, part of the beauty of why WooCommerce is so popular is the flexibility, and I don&#8217;t think the usability is there &#8212; yet &#8212; to be competitive with, like, a  Shopify, or a BigCommerce. So, it&#8217;s just a lot of work to do there.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">Matt said he thinks of WooCommerce as how WordPress was around version 1.5. He called it, &#8220;very early days&#8221;</span>, in that people are using it and see the potential, but says, &#8220;there&#8217;s just so much to work on and improve to make it accessible to a wider audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He says the Woo team is now 63 people, and a number of Automatticians are doing &#8220;Wootations,&#8221; or rotations with the Woo team.</p>\n<h3>What to expect next in the new WordPress.com interface</h3>\n<p>They are still working on a lot of things for the new interface. There are certain things that aren&#8217;t there yet. For instance, showing and hiding your sites you are personally attached to still requires the regular admin. I actually experienced this myself. Some parts of the interface are pretty circular and confusing.</p>\n<p>But they plan to do more going forward; their values on the project state that, &#8220;we are here for the long haul.&#8221; They want to see what there is demand for, and what other people do with the open source nature of the project.</p>\n<p>Matt also noted that he&#8217;d like to &#8220;loop back&#8221; to content blocks (code named <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/\">CEUX</a>) &#8212; the project that stalled last year. And he&#8217;s like to see what can be done around collaboration, editing, and the suggestion process.</p>\n<h3>Power and ease of use</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for WordPress is to continue to get easier to use, as other avenues for sharing information have gotten easier and easier, while continuing to enable powerful, feature rich implementations of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Matt thinks this balance is important, and that we must continue to improve in both directions to continue WordPress&#8217;s growth.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping up</h3>\n<p>I really enjoyed my first audio interview with Matt. He says we can expect more announcements around WordCamp US, which starts next week.</p>\n<p>The Calypso project is a fascinating one, and it&#8217;s a great example of what we should continue to expect: powerful, catered tools that run on a RESTful API. They aren&#8217;t always going to be tools for use everywhere, but we can expect to continue to see WordPress used in innovative ways, and be an exceptional platform for all kinds of applications.</p>\n<p>And finally, at the end of the interview, I pitched Matt on one of my most harebrained ideas. The naming conflict between WordPress.com and WordPress was really bad with this project, as nearly everyone not deeply embedded within the WordPress world got it wrong, and conflated Automattic&#8217;s WordPress.com with WordPress the software.</p>\n<p>And I think Jetpack&#8217;s brand has really blossomed. I think there is an argument to be made that Automattic could change the name of WordPress.com to Jetpack, and both Automattic and WordPress would win from the change. It wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but all I asked from him, is whether he&#8217;d read my post if I wrote one to give the pitch. He said he would, so expect that sometime soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Matt for the interview, and thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markarms\">Mark Armstrong</a> for helping me get going with the new WordPress.com app and arranging the interview.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/07/wcsf-contributor-day-2013/\">* Photo credit Sheri Bigelow</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 19:13:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: The WordPress Theme Directory Replaces Download Counts With the Number of Active Installs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=49123\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-replaces-download-counts-with-the-number-of-active-installs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3429:\"<p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design\">WordPress plugin directory was redesigned</a>. As part of the redesign, download counts were replaced with the number of Active Installs to reflect more accurate data. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress theme directory</a> has finally followed suit by replacing download counts with the number of Active Installs.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49125\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49125\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png?resize=891%2C547\" alt=\"Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen\" /></a>Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen\n<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, the Twenty Fifteen default theme included in WordPress 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, is active on more than one million sites. Active themes are those that are activated and in use on a site. Themes that are installed and not activated are not counted, neither are child themes.</p>\n<p>In the Themereview Slack Channel, Tom Usborne <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998481000578\">explains why</a> active installs for child themes should be counted.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think an argument for child themes to be included in the active installs count can be made. For example, we offer a completely blank child theme for our customers so they can make CSS and PHP adjustments. This means our install count isn&#8217;t accurate on w.org, even though those people are using the theme actively.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dion Hulse, WordPress lead developer, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998501000579\">agrees</a> that child themes should be counted but the team doesn&#8217;t have the data yet. Some theme authors are concerned that new themes will have a tough time making it on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/\">popular themes page</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally, the popular themes page was determined by the number of downloads over the previous week, which led to some authors to try to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-no-longer-counts-automated-downloads\">game the system</a>. Hulse says, &#8220;The actual comparison between active installs and the previous week&#8217;s downloads were very similar, except for a handful of themes that had a lot more downloads than installs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hulse plans to experiment with the algorithms to give newer themes a chance, &#8220;I’m also looking at ranking popular themes based on the age of the theme and installs, which will help promote some of the newer themes,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Thanks to active install counts for themes, we can see which default WordPress theme is the most popular.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty Fifteen 1+ Million</li>\n<li>Twenty Fourteen 800K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Twelve 500K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Eleven 500K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Ten 300K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Thirteen 300K+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download counts are a terrible way to determine a theme or plugin&#8217;s popularity which is why I support this change. It&#8217;s more accurate and helps to further level the playing field for authors.

I’ve just never packaged it up and made it useful for others,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49114\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49114\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png?resize=1025%2C618\" alt=\"Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend\" /></a>Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend\n<p>Under the hood, it uses a custom post type, taxonomies, custom metadata, and a number of hooks. Theme Designer can pull data from the WordPress.org theme directory API and store it on your site. There’s also a built-in feature set for adding custom meta fields to the edit theme screen.</p>\n<p>In addition to managing themes, Tadlock plans to create add-ons and integrate Theme Designer with other plugins.

When the beta is complete, Tadlock will charge for access making it his first major commercial plugin. Theme Designer will come in two flavors, a supported and non-supported version.</p>\n<p>The supported version gives customers a <strong>developer level</strong> membership to Theme Hybrid which is currently $35 a year. The non-supported version contains the plugin only. Both versions will have free lifetime updates.</p>\n<p>To participate in the beta testing process, grab the free plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-designer\">from GitHub</a>.

Blogging has always been mistaken for its containers, tools, the length of the posts or just a replacement for the rapid-fire publishing of old-fashioned news. In reality, blogging is essentially a philosophy built on the ethos of sharing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today sharing on the internet is a major social behavior: We share photos, links, videos, thoughts, opinions, news. Except instead of sharing on a blog, we do the sharing in increasingly proprietary and corporate silos: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Periscope and LinkedIn. You see, the blogging ethos is alive and well. However, the old blogging tools have to embrace change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s not about technology for technology&#8217;s sake, it&#8217;s about technology at the service of human voices. Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, it was a weird coincidence we didn&#8217;t even notice, but the Calypso announcement was <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2005/11/23/opening-it-up/\">ten years to the day after we opened up WordPress.com</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 19:42:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Automattic Unveils Open Source WordPress.com Desktop Application for the Mac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=49077\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5489:\"<p>In the last two years, Automattic has made significant improvements to WordPress.com and Jetpack.

The individual changes represent iteration but when seen as a whole, show off an entirely new WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Automattic has <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/\">announced</a> that the improvements its made in the last two years are part of an internal project <a href=\"https://desktop.wordpress.com/\">named Calypso</a>. The company also released a WordPress.com desktop application for the Mac and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/\">open sourced</a> the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The application is written entirely in JavaScript using the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> libraries. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\">100% reliant</a> on APIs, including the REST API.</p>\n<h2>My Experience with Calypso</h2>\n<p>Over the weekend, I tested the application on my Macbook Pro. I initially thought it was inconsistent as there were many instances where a button opened a browser and took me outside the app. However, Calypso has gone through a number of updates and most of the inconsistencies have disappeared.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49080\"><img class=\"wp-image-49080 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png?resize=1025%2C795\" alt=\"Calypso1\" /></a>Calypso\n<p>Most of what you&#8217;re able to accomplish in the WordPress backend you can do in the app including, editing posts, creating drafts, and moderating comments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49081\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49081\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png?resize=1025%2C799\" alt=\"Calypso2\" /></a>Although there is the occasional Beep&#8230;.Beep&#8230;.Boop, the application is fast. Some of the pages within the app feel like they load faster than their browser counterparts. Some things still require action from within a browser such as applying updates. This doesn&#8217;t make sense considering the Jetpack Manage module is enabled.</p>\n<p>When managing themes, I noticed at least two of the them don&#8217;t include the white bottom bar making the titles difficult to read. Also, the details link loads a browser window to the backend of the site I&#8217;m managing. It feels like an interruption instead of a seamless experience. There should be no reason to load a browser window except for previewing a post.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49082\"><img class=\"wp-image-49082 size-full\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png?resize=1025%2C790\" alt=\"Calypso3\" /></a>Managing Themes in Calypso\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with or use the WordPress.com post editor, the editor in Calypso is pretty much the same.</p>\n<p>For years I&#8217;ve written posts with meta boxes on the right and getting used to them on the left will take a while. The editor has most of the features available in WordPress. For example, oEmbed support which many other third-party WordPress apps don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>When the application is in full-screen mode, it looks great and blocks out distractions. In the most recent update however, the Preview button acts like a Save button and doesn&#8217;t show a preview of the post. This is likely a bug and will be fixed in a later version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49083\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49083\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png?resize=1025%2C790\" alt=\"CalypsoPostEditingScreen\" /></a>Calypso is a great example of what&#8217;s possible with the WordPress REST API. There are still a few instances when clicking a button takes you outside the app but those will be fixed in future updates.</p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s convenient to have access to most of WordPress&#8217; features without interacting with a browser. For those who use a Mac, I can easily see Calypso being the preferred way to interact and manage WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>As Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/\">mentions in his post</a>, there&#8217;s still a lot of work left to do, &#8220;This is a beginning, not an ending.

Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in.&#8221; Calypso is <a href=\"https://desktop.wordpress.com/\">available for free</a> but you&#8217;ll need a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/start\">WordPress.com account</a> which is also free.</p>\n<p>If you own a Mac and test drive Calypso, please share your experience with us in the comments.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:01:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Post Status: Automattic has released an open source WordPress.com Mac app\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-mac-app/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5070:\"<p>Today, Automattic released their official WordPress.com Mac app, that was codenamed <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/\">Calypso</a> during development, that allows users to manage both WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites using a desktop interface. The code behind the app is also the foundation for a new version of the WordPress.com browser editor.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video walkthrough:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new WordPress.com app development occurred over the course of at least 18 months, according to the press release, with input from more than 140 Automatticians. <a href=\"http://apeatling.com/about-me/\">Andy Peatling</a>, who has been at Automattic since 2008, was the project lead.</p>\n<h3>If you could rebuild the admin from scratch</h3>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg said that Automattic wanted to completely rethink the WordPress admin experience, without the burden of backward compatibility that WordPress core must hold sacred:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we’ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Calypso was an ambitious project. Not only does it bring the WordPress editing and publishing experience to a Mac app, but pretty much the entire WordPress.com admin experience is now available on the desktop, from stats to theme shopping.</p>\n<p>While the app is definitely geared toward the experience one would expect on a WordPress.com website, you can also manage <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/2015/11/23/jwordpress-com-app-for-mac/\">Jetpack enabled</a> websites with it. The Jetpack Manage feature must be enabled for it to work, and I admit I struggled to get it to function with my own (personal) website. However, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get any kinks worked out, and anyone looking for basic website management, but are on WordPress.org, may enjoy the experience.</p>\n<h3>Open sourcing WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>The most important part of the announcement is that Automattic is open sourcing Calypso and the many APIs that help drive it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with Javascript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I’m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m really glad they chose to open source it. I agree with Matt that both the app and the broader community will benefit from the decision; though I don&#8217;t doubt it may have been a tough sell to investors.</p>\n<p>I also agree with Ben Thompson (a former Automattician, by chance), <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/tensorflow-and-monetizing-intellectual-property/\">who once said</a> that proprietary software itself isn&#8217;t necessarily what makes a company successful, but rather, &#8220;companies that are built on software but differentiated by a difficult-to-replicate complement to said software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Automattic&#8217;s case, open sourcing the techniques to build the app isn&#8217;t giving away what is most valuable. What is most valuable to them is what they gain from the open source nature of the software, that will allow them to improve the experience for their vast WordPress.com user base.</p>\n<h3>Calypso is a good step forward for WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worried for a while now that Automattic may be letting their audience slip, by falling behind the ease of use of other tools, like Medium. I think the new WordPress.com editor, and the corresponding WordPress.com app, are a great improvement to the writing experience, and I think that the investment they&#8217;ve made is a smart one.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be digging more into the code and developer components of the new APIs and the Mac app soon. I didn&#8217;t have access to that data prior to launch.</p>\n<p>The new app is available for <a href=\"http://desktop.wordpress.com/\">download from WordPress.com</a> now, or you can of course test drive the browser version directly on WordPress.com.

When I took on the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\">responsibility of CEO of Automattic January of last year</a>, we faced two huge problems: our growth was constrained by lack of capital, and the technological foundations of the past decade weren’t strong enough for the demands of next one.</p>\n<p>The first has a relatively straightforward answer. We found some fantastic partners, agreed on a fair price, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/\">issued new equity in the company to raise $160M</a>, and started investing in areas we felt were high potential, like <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/\">this year’s WooCommerce acquisition</a>. This &#8220;war chest&#8221; gives us a huge array of options, especially given our fairly flat burn rate &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to raise money again to keep the company going, and any capital we raise in the future will be purely discretionary. (Since last May when the round happened we&#8217;ve only spent $3M of the investment on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense\">opex</a>.)</p>\n<p>The second is much harder to address. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> codebase is actually incredible in many ways &#8212; the result of many thousands of people collaborating over 13 years &#8212; but some of WordPress’ greatest strengths were also holding it back.</p>\n<p>The WordPress codebase contains a sea of institutional knowledge and countless bug fixes. It handles hundreds of edge cases. Integrates constant security improvements. Is coded to scale. Development moves at a fast clip, with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\">six major releases over the past two years</a> and more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-4/\">around the corner</a>. Its power and flexibility is undeniable: WordPress just passed a huge milestone, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/\">and now powers 25% of the web</a>. You can run it on a $5-a-month web host, or scale it up to serve billions of pageviews on one of the largest sites on the web, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The interface, however, has been a struggle. Many of us attempted to give it a reboot with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/\">MP6 project</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/\">version 3.8 release</a>, but what that release made clear to me is that an incremental approach wouldn&#8217;t give us the improvements we needed, and that two of the things that helped make WordPress the strong, stable, powerful tool it is &#8212; backward compatibility and working without JavaScript &#8212; were actually holding it back.</p>\n<p>The basic paradigms of wp-admin are largely the same as they were five years ago. Working within them had become limiting. The time seemed ripe for something new, something big… but if you&#8217;re going to break back compat, it needs to be for a really good reason. A 20x improvement, not a 2x. Most open source projects fade away rather than make evolutionary jumps.</p>\n<p>So we asked ourselves a big question. <strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we&#8217;ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing something brand new, a new approach to WordPress, and open sourcing the code behind it. The project, codenamed Calypso, is the culmination of more than 20 months of work by dozens of the most talented engineers and designers I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with (127 contributors with over 26,000 commits!).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45613\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/11/gm-2015-final.jpg?resize=604%2C431\" alt=\"gm-2015-final\" /></p>\n<p>Calypso is&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incredibly fast.

The post includes data that shows the number of plugins added to the directory per year, what year the plugins were last updated, and other metrics.</p>\n<p>My favorite data point is the number of plugins approved per year. Based on this data, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be another record year for the directory. The five active team members including, Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Samuel Wood have their work cut out for them.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49062\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49062\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png?resize=939%2C684\" alt=\"Number of Plugins Added Per Year\" /></a>Number of Plugins Added Per Year\n<p>According to the data, about 22K plugins have been updated in the last 24 months representing a little more than half the directory.

If you pick a free plugin that is released today, there’s a 80-90% chance that in three years time you won’t have any more updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a number of possibilities as to why a plugin doesn&#8217;t get updated for two years or more.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The developer burns out or moves on.</li>\n<li>The plugin doesn&#8217;t need an update.</li>\n<li>Lack of donations.</li>\n<li>Support is too much of a burden.</li>\n<li>No time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The data doesn&#8217;t spell doom and gloom for users but it clearly shows that many plugins within the directory don&#8217;t have a long shelf life. I encourage you to <a href=\"https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/\">read Fracassi&#8217;s post</a> and review the data he&#8217;s collected.

Some theme authors are having to <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=time&col=changetime&report=5&order=priority\">wait two months</a> or more for their first review.</p>\n<p>Ashley Evans submitted <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318\">her theme</a> in June and she&#8217;s yet to complete the review process. Throughout that time period, both Evans and the reviewer experienced delays in responding to each other. A few months into the review, the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:21\">reviewer disappeared</a> and Evans was <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:23\">assigned a new reviewer</a> two days ago.</p>\n<p>Understandably, the experience has discouraged Evan&#8217;s from submitting anymore themes to the directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in August, I said, &#8216;Screw it&#8217; and released the theme as a free download on my blog. This process has basically made me vow to stick to adding plugins to the repo and stop adding any more themes.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not blaming the theme review team since I can only imagine how much stuff they have to wade through. It&#8217;s just sad that the process has discouraged me from ever doing it again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On October 9th, Tammie Lister <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/09/forgotten-review-push-sometimes-themes-get-forgotten-in/\">updated the Theme Review queues</a> and identified a number of themes that fell through the cracks.

In June, the team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/\">published its suggested roadmap</a> to improve multiple facets of the review process. One of the items on the list to help cut down the review queue is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/\">auto-approval</a> of theme updates. However, the team is still hard at work trying to code and implement changes to improve the system.</p>\n<h2>Help Them Help You</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-27795\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-27795\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg?resize=1025%2C487\" alt=\"photo credit: Rob Shenk via - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsj/2915797223/\">Rob Shenk</a> via &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>One of the items high on the team&#8217;s to-do list is to put more effort towards education. In order to do that, Justin Tadlock says the team has to free up resources, &#8220;We need to free up our biggest resources, which are the team members themselves. However, we can&#8217;t free up those people when they&#8217;re spending 100% of their time doing reviews.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important thing theme authors can do to speed up the review process is to check that your theme meets the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/\">Theme Review Requirements</a>. According to Tadlock, &#8220;The majority of themes submitted don&#8217;t follow the guidelines which considerably slows down the process. Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point to where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn&#8217;t have a queue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme authors who test their themes against <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test\">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check Plugin</a> substantially improve the system for everyone. What the team needs most is help. Tadlock offers three ways contributors can get involved to improve the situation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">Doing reviews</a>.</li>\n<li>Tackling Meta Trac tickets related to the theme directory.</li>\n<li>Writing tutorials.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tadlock isn&#8217;t sure how to get theme authors to raise the quality of their themes before the initial review, &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of feedback I want to see from fellow theme authors. What do we need to do to help them get their themes ready before submission?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>\n<p>The team is always in need of more theme reviewers. Reviewing themes is a great way to learn theme development and what not to do. If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing themes, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">following document</a> from the Theme Review Handbook. It explains how to set up a testing environment with an example of a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/review-workflow/\">testing workflow</a>.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team also has a project meeting every <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20151110T1800\"><abbr class=\"date\" title=\"2015-11-10T18:00:00+00:00\">Tuesday, November 10, 2015, 1:00 PM EST</abbr></a> in the <strong>#themereview</strong> channel on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<h2>Exercise Patience</h2>\n<p>Exercising patience is a difficult thing to do if you&#8217;ve already waited eight weeks or more for the first review. However, fixing the system is going to take time. If you want to know about the status of your theme and it has an assigned reviewer, you should ask for a status update within the ticket. If your theme doesn&#8217;t have an assigned reviewer, you can ask about its status in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Theme Review Team Slack</a> channel with a link to the theme.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:20:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Imperva’s Web Application Attack Report Shows Spam Is WordPress’ Largest Security Threat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"http://wptavern.com/impervas-web-application-attack-report-shows-spam-is-wordpress-largest-security-threat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6738:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.imperva.com\">Imperva</a>, an international cyber security company founded in 2002, published its <a href=\"http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf\">2015 web application attack report</a>. The report includes a thorough analysis of attack data obtained through its WAF or Web Application Firewall.</p>\n<p>In the report, Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed 297,954 attacks and 22,850,023 alerts on 198 of the applications it protects behind its WAF. The data is from January 1st, 2015 &#8211; June 30th, 2015 and provides a solid overview of the number and types of attacks web applications are experiencing.</p>\n<p>The report covers a lot of ground but for the purpose of this site, I&#8217;m focusing on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Analysis Methodology</h2>\n<p>Automated tools recorded the web applications’ traffic and malicious events were documented in log files. Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed the data using special-purpose software and its knowledge base.</p>\n<p>You can find more information that explains how the data was analyzed on page seven of the report.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Is the Most Attacked CMS Application</h2>\n<p>Out of the 198 applications protected, Imperva identified 55 that are CMS-based, 20 WordPress applications, 11 Drupal, and 24 that are based on 11 other CMS frameworks.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48998\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48998\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png?resize=875%2C470\" alt=\"Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice\" /></a>Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice\n<p>According to the report, CMS applications suffered an average of three times more attacks than non-CMS applications. WordPress applications suffered from 3,497 attacks in the reported period which is 250% more than non-CMS Applications. Note from the above image that spam attacks against WordPress outnumber all other types of attacks.</p>\n<p>Imperva says the attraction to CMS applications, especially WordPress is not new.</p>\n<blockquote><p>CMS frameworks have an open nature,  with open developer communities that generate a never-ending sequence of plug-ins and add-ons, with varying levels of security. This situation has led to corresponding never-ending flow of CMS vulnerabilities, with WordPress as the leading CMS taking the lead also in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that WordPress and other CMS applications resemble each other facilitates automated scanning attacks that work effectively on all applications of this type with only minimal adjustments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Varying levels of security in plugins have led to many vulnerabilities making WordPress the leader in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<h2>Proportions of Attacks</h2>\n<p>Taking spam attacks out of the equation, the most popular attack type against WordPress applications is (RCE) Remote Command Execution with (RFI) Remote File Inclusion taking second place.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49000\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49000\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png?resize=719%2C400\" alt=\"Proportion of Attack Types\" /></a>Proportion of Attack Types\n<ul>\n<li>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an attack that allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script, on the web server. This attack can lead to data theft or manipulation, malicious code execution on the web server, or malicious code execution on the application client side such as JavaScript execution, which can lead to other attacks. This vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote Command Execution (RCE) is an attack that allows the attacker to execute operating system commands in a system shell. The attack exploits applications that suffer from insufficient input validation in conjunction with passing this input to a system shell. The attacker’s payload is executed with the same privileges of the vulnerable application and can lead to full compromise of the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though the other monitored CMS applications are written in PHP, RFI attacks on WordPress are significantly higher than all other applications. Imperva offers one possible explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Attackers don’t target a specific application, but start with scanning the Internet for vulnerable applications. A Low Hanging Fruit approach that is simple and effective for the detection of potential RFI targets, would be to run a WordPress test and mount an RFI attack in case of success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf\">report</a> goes on to show geographic attack trends, PHP vs non-PHP attack incidents, traffic volume, case studies, and more.</p>\n<h2>No Need to Panic</h2>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s only six months of data, the results don&#8217;t surprise me. WordPress is <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-quarter-of-the-top-10-million-sites-ranked-by-alexa-use-wordpress\">used on a quarter of the top 10 million websites</a> ranked by Alexa so of course its going to be the most attacked CMS.</p>\n<p>The data in the report reinforces my belief that every public site online is likely being scanned or attacked multiple times a day. Unless you&#8217;re using a service or plugin that logs these types of attacks, its hard to know how popular of a target a site is.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re aware of a plugin or service that provides a user-friendly interface that shows and explains the attacks it&#8217;s protecting against a site, please send me a link in the comments.</p>\n<h2>Basic Security Principles</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s imperative that you use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication\">strong password</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication\">two-factor authentication</a>. Consider using a service like <a href=\"https://getclef.com/\">Clef</a> that allows you to login to WordPress without a password. I also highly encourage you to read the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-publishes-security-white-paper\">WordPress security whitepaper</a> to learn how WordPress protects itself against common attacks mentioned in Imperva&#8217;s report and how to responsibly disclose a WordPress security vulnerability.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:11:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Freelancer Adam Soucie on the Dangers of Accepting Credit Cards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-freelancer-adam-soucie-on-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2202:\"<p>If you&#8217;re running or opening a new WordPress business, you should read <a href=\"http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/\">Adam Soucie&#8217;s warning</a> on the dangers of accepting credit cards. Soucie, a WordPress Developer based in Orlando, Florida describes what happened after working with a client that claimed to be hearing disabled.</p>\n<p>Soucie went through the usual process of sending over a contract, bringing in a designer, discussing scope, and sending over an invoice. The client then claimed to be in the hospital and requested help to pay for one of the contractors involved in the project because he didn&#8217;t accept credit cards. According to Soucie, this should have been the red flag:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I ignored it because I’ve also been a trusting person who is sympathetic to people with disabilities.  Plus I figured I had proof of everything, so I’d be protected.  I was so wrong.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short, the &#8216;client&#8217; was paying with stolen credit cards and the other contractor was in on the scam.  I discovered the scam when they started getting pushy about the contractor receiving his payments.  When leaving to make the final payment, I got a call from the person whose credit card info was stolen.  I reached out to my &#8216;client&#8217; and she had disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the merchant, Soucie was liable for the transaction. After not receiving help from the FBI Cyber Crimes division and the credit card companies, QuickBooks, Soucie&#8217;s payment processor, went after him for the total amount of $10,000. He was able to get the amount slightly reduced after working with QuickBooks. What looked like an awesome project quickly turned into a nightmare.</p>\n<p>I highly encourage you to <a href=\"http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/\">read his article</a> as it includes tips to protect yourself and why you shouldn&#8217;t be too trusting.

Haskins was initially going to list the company on Flippa but after receiving advice from <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\">Syed Balkhi</a>, used <a href=\"http://feinternational.com/\">FE International</a> to facilitate the sale. FE International is composed of website brokers that do the heavy lifting to help businesses find buyers.</p>\n<p>An anonymous company based on the US East Coast without ties to the WordPress community is the new owner of Aesop Interactive LLC. Although terms of the deal are not public, Haskins confirms that he received close to his asking price of $100K.</p>\n<p>When Haskins put the company up for sale, he specified two conditions the new owner must follow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aesop Story Engine MUST absolutely be maintained and kept free.</li>\n<li>Editus must continue forward with development, in some way shape or form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the new owner&#8217;s plans are for Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM.</p>\n<h2>Advice for Selling Your Company</h2>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem is filled with thousands of companies from individuals to 50+ person agencies. Haskins offers the following advice for those thinking about selling their business, &#8220;Make sure that the books are buttoned up tight, because every check, every payment, every expense will be scrutinized and will ultimately determine what the appraisal price will be. Run a lean ship as the less overhead you have, the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the appraisal process, Haskins had to account for and explain every check number written during the last few months. Although it was a lot of work on his end, he highly recommends using FE International as they manage the negotiating, contract writing, and appraisal processes.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next for Haskins?</h2>\n<p>Haskins isn&#8217;t giving up WordPress development as he continues to work with the software on a daily basis managing <a href=\"https://cgcookie.com/\">CGCookie</a>. When I asked what&#8217;s next in his WordPress journey, he replied, &#8220;Overall, there will be another project. It&#8217;s just that this chapter of the story is finished. I want to eventually write and publish an eBook on my experiences of starting, running, and selling a business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Who do you think the buyer is and what do you think will happen to Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 22:31:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Tickets on Sale for WordCamp Europe 2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48959\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/tickets-on-sale-for-wordcamp-europe-2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2056:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordCampEuropeFeaturedImage2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48961\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48961\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordCampEuropeFeaturedImage2.png?resize=1025%2C450\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe Featured Image\" /></a>Nearly seven months before the event takes place, tickets for <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/\">WordCamp Europe 2016</a> in Vienna, Austria on June 24-26 <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/tickets/\">are on sale. </a> There are two types of tickets available, General admission and Microsponsor.</p>\n<p>General admission tickets are € 40.00 each and cover both days to the event, <span class=\"tix-ticket-excerpt\">access to all sessions, lunch, coffee breaks, warm up events, and the after party.

Launched in 2009 as a plugin called Site Monitor, the service has evolved over time to allow users to upgrade themes, plugins, and WordPress remotely. The service allows an unlimited amount of sites to be tracked for free.</p>\n<p>Human Made is not able to devote the time and resources necessary to maintain the service, even as it continues to do well. According to Tom Willmot, Co-founder and CEO of Human Made, the team backed out of the <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/\">premium version</a> of the service due to a lack of resources:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/blog/\">ambitious plans for a version 2</a>, we <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/\">introduced a premium version</a> that we backed out of because we didn’t have the resources to run and grow it, and we’ve got lots of great ideas both from its users and ourselves that we haven’t been able to act on. We’re too busy with other things, including Happytables, our client work, events, and more.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WP Remote has over 18K users with more than 96K sites monitored. Here are some other notable statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,850 people logged in during the past 30 days.</li>\n<li>1,200 of those have more than five sites added to their account and 110 of them have more than 50 sites monitored.</li>\n<li>In the past 30 days WP Remote was used to perform over 20,000 plugin updates.</li>\n<li>Each week between 50 and 100 new users sign up and over half of them go on to add a site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although WP Remote converted 60 free users to its premium service, the company eliminated it due to the lack of internal resources to support, develop, and market it. WP Remote also has key relationships with web hosting companies such as, Pressable, BlueHost, and SiteGround.</p>\n<p>Before inquiring about purchasing the service, I recommend that you <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/08/08/the-story-of-wp-remote/\">read the history</a> on how it was created.

The site launched earlier this year and has more than 170 plugins listed in the directory. Gliebe doesn&#8217;t have the time to manage the project anymore and is looking to give it to someone who is capable of maximizing the site&#8217;s potential.</p>\n<p>Since May of this year, commercial plugin developers have slowly added their products to the directory. Gliebe explains his original strategy for monetizing the site, &#8220;Build the directory up (get authors to list their plugins) in order to attract traffic (plugin buyers) then monetize it with display ads, affiliate links and/or sponsorships (not yet started).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gliebe spends 1-2 hours per week managing the directory which includes, moderating submissions, moderating comments, moderating reviews, answering emails, and responding to tweets. He suggests that the new owner will need to spend more time marketing in order for the project to keep growing.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting parts of the sale offer is where Gliebe explains what powers the site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, the <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/frontend-submissions/\" target=\"_blank\">Frontend Submissions</a> extension, the <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/product-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Product Reviews</a> extension and Array’s <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Checkout</a> theme (using a child theme for customizations like showing categories on the homepage).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the analytics, the site is experiencing low traffic numbers compared to when the site was launched. However, organic search traffic is steadily rising thanks to the content published on the <a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/blog/\">site&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48925\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48925\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png?resize=814%2C1216\" alt=\"Pro Plugin Directory Traffic\" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Traffic\n<p>Outside of Codecanyon, Pro Plugin Directory is one of the only other directories exclusively catered to commercial plugins. Here&#8217;s what Gliebe will give the buyer after purchasing the site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The buyer will receive the domain, website files, database dump, mailing lists and Twitter account. Easy Digital Downloads add-on licenses and Checkout theme licenses will be transferred. You will need to purchase a new SSL certificate. I am looking for a capable buyer but if you require migration assistance or technical support after the sale, I will offer my services at $200/hour (five hours max).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Escrow will be used to facilitate the sale between both parties.

Any businessman, any executive could live almost anywhere on earth and still do his business through a device like this, and this is a wonderful thing, it means we won&#8217;t have to be stuck in cities, we can live out in the country or wherever we please, and still carry on complete interaction with human beings, as well as with other computers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wow, extremely prescient.

The dominant technology companies of today still follow the same office-centric model as when computers took up entire rooms, but the dominant companies of tomorrow will be built and grow in a completely distributed fashion.

The <a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">schedule and sessions</a> are published and it looks like an informational packed two-day event.</p>\n<p>There are three tracks available, two of which will have typical length sessions with a third track dedicated to lightning talks.

During contributor day, people from all walks of life get together and contribute to various parts of the WordPress project whether it&#8217;s the support forums, core code, documentation, and more. Mentors will be on hand to help new contributors.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the most important information is where to eat a great tasting cheesesteak.

Only 10.6% of WordPress sites are in Chinese with 6.9% for Korean.</p>\n<p>About 94% of sites surveyed use a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu.

Earlier this year, we learned that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share\">Jetpack is going to play a significant role</a> in WordPress gaining 50% or more of market share.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg explains the path to 50% and beyond.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and there’s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we haven’t done in the past – really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>\n<p>What got us here isn’t going to get us there. Once we get to 50%, we can decide something new we want to do</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic is experimenting with a new side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/jetpack-onboarding\">Jetpack Onboarding</a>.

Communicating online is hard but where and how you communicate affects the likelihood of making an impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cmscritic.com/\">CMS Critic</a> is a site I&#8217;ve read for years as it routinely publishes articles on a variety of content management systems, including WordPress.</p>\n<p>In late October, Kaya Ismail <a href=\"http://www.cmscritic.com/how-wordpress-needs-to-improve-itself/\">published an article</a> that describes how WordPress needs to improve itself in six ways. What could have been a great article, is instead a great example of <strong>how not to</strong> communicate grievances you have with WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Developers Are Lazy</h2>\n<p>Many people, including myself <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme#comments\">have an opinion</a> of the Twenty Sixteen theme in WordPress 4.4. Ismail thinks the developers behind the theme are lazy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I totally understand that WordPress doesn&#8217;t need to compete with the massive library of third-party themes available out there, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they should lead with a default theme as bad as that. It&#8217;s nothing short of lazy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tammie Lister, Takashi Irie, and others continue to work hard on Twenty Sixteen to prepare it for the WordPress 4.4 release in December. They are far from lazy people making Ismail&#8217;s opinion more of an insult. He doesn&#8217;t provide any examples or ideas on what should be in a default theme.</p>\n<h2>The WordPress Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>According to Ismail, the WordPress plugin directory is filled with large chunks of trash in addition to great plugins. While some plugins in the directory could be coded better, his explanation falls short of describing a solution.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many plugins simply don&#8217;t work, while many more are poorly put together, which in turn makes WordPress as a platform harder to use. Quality control needs to improve.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t link to plugins that are broken, provide any code samples, or show where quality control is lacking. His statement is an assumption that&#8217;s not backed by evidence.</p>\n<p>Those who <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein\">oversee the plugin directory</a> don&#8217;t test every submitted plugin to make sure it works with WordPress. Among other things, their job is to make sure plugin submissions don&#8217;t have security issues. If the moderators performed quality control on every plugin, the submission queue would likely have a substantial backlog.</p>\n<p>Instead of writing baseless assumptions, Ismail should monitor the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/\">Make WordPress Plugins</a> site to stay on top of what&#8217;s going on with the plugin directory and submit feedback where necessary. If a broken plugin is discovered, he should create a forum thread within the plugin&#8217;s support area.</p>\n<p>This way, his feedback is seen by those who directly control the WordPress plugin directory. The simple act of reporting a broken plugin to the developer is a major step towards being part of the solution and not the problem.</p>\n<h2>Admin Menu Clutter</h2>\n<p>I agree with Ismail&#8217;s opinion that the WordPress admin menus can become cluttered if the right plugins are activated. At least in this case, he suggests an alternative.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to see WordPress group third-party menu options together, in a way that&#8217;s a little more organized and less intrusive. Perhaps this can be done by giving them a sub-section within the menu which can be collapsed. The solution itself is up to them, but the problem is evident.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Menus\">are guidelines</a> for when plugin developers should create top-level or sub-level menu items but they&#8217;re not followed as well as they could be. Without strictly enforcing these guidelines, it&#8217;s out of WordPress&#8217; hands. The complaint is aimed in the wrong direction and should point towards third-party developers, not WordPress itself.</p>\n<p>If you want more control in how items are displayed in the admin menu, I recommend using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/\">Menu Humility</a> plugin by Mark Jaquith.</p>\n<h2>Akismet is Not Enough</h2>\n<p>According to Ismail, comment spam is a major issue with WordPress sites and Akismet doesn&#8217;t do enough to stop it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akismet, a spam comment filter, now comes with every WordPress install &#8211; which is a good thing. But the free version doesn&#8217;t do enough for me, as comments still pile up in the back end. If you ask me, WordPress needs to find another way to turn the unrelenting tide of spam.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To clarify, Akismet has been bundled with WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/12/wp2/\">version 2.0</a> and there&#8217;s no difference between the free and commercial versions in how Akismet protects sites. He doesn&#8217;t provide any suggestions on what WordPress could do to thwart spam but says it has to do something.</p>\n<p>What are members of the WordPress core team supposed to do with this kind of feedback? It&#8217;s not helpful, doesn&#8217;t provide any ideas, and is easy to discard.</p>\n<h2>Updates are Hard</h2>\n<p>Depending on your webhost&#8217;s configuration, updating themes, plugins, and WordPress is as simple as clicking a button. For the more adventurous, you can configure them to happen automatically. For Ismail, the update process is difficult.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Updating a plugin may cause conflicts between it and another plugin. Updating a theme can erase your modifications (unless you use a child theme), whereas updating WordPress itself can render a variety of your plugins redundant until their developers apply a patch. Confused yet? You should be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He makes a few good points but editing a theme instead of a child theme is like editing WordPress core files which should almost never happen. It&#8217;s true that there is a slight risk of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites\">things breaking</a> after an update but it&#8217;s more of an anomaly than a common occurrence.</p>\n<p>Ismail suggests that WordPress look into preserving theme changes across the board and to provide alerts if  plugins interfere with each other. I like these suggestions and my hope is that one day, WordPress will be able to create a snapshot during the update process to provide assurance that the site won&#8217;t break after an update is applied.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Hack-a-thon</h2>\n<p>Ismail&#8217;s last point is how WordPress can improve its security.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think we can all agree that WordPress needs to beef itself up (by shoring up its admin login page, for example), but I call for it to go a step further and start offering better protection, even if it comes at a small price.</p>\n<p>Third party solutions exist, sure. But why should I have to patch together several security plugins, each with their own confusing settings, just to secure my website? Many WordPress users have become accustom to handling their own security in this way; but I think WordPress needs to take on more responsibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He wants WordPress to go a step further and offer better protection but doesn&#8217;t say what that protection is. He also doesn&#8217;t explain where, how, or why WordPress should take on more responsibility to make sites more secure.</p>\n<h2>Be Part of the Solution, Not the Problem</h2>\n<p>Ismail concludes his article by saying it&#8217;s time for WordPress to innovate. He also says, &#8220;The onus isn&#8217;t on me to provide the solution, it&#8217;s upon WordPress. And it&#8217;s about time they started coming up with innovative solutions for their long-standing issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The article is <a href=\"https://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-4.4-beta-bare-bones/\">another example</a> of how CMS Critic chooses not to be part of the solution. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but airing grievances which sound more like demands and telling core developers to start innovating is not a recipe for results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/\">This quote</a> from WordPress core developer, Mark Jaquith, eloquently describes how important communication skills are in an open source project.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The number one skill you need for just about any job, but specifically working on open source, is communication skills. You need to have clarity, consistency, compassion, relatability, a little bit of a thick skin and a decent sense of humor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The onus may not be on Ismail or any of us to come up with solutions, but he and others can help discover and be part of solutions by taking an active role in giving constructive feedback in <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/2015/11/03/a-non-developers-guide-to-getting-involved-in-wordpress-core-development/\">the right place</a>.

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>\n<p>A great example <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress\">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717\">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>\n<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Nov 2015 08:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Daniel Bachhuber Raises More Than $17.5K to Develop a RESTful WP-CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48819\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/daniel-bachhuber-raises-more-than-17-5k-to-develop-a-restful-wp-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1664:\"<p><a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, who maintains <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI</a>, has successfully raised more than $21K through his <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli\">Kickstarter campaign</a>.

The page features a timeline where visitors can browse every major version of WordPress released since 1.0. Versions are displayed in a horizontal timeline format with fancy animations when hovered over.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48815\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48815\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png?resize=1025%2C554\" alt=\"WordPress Time Machine\" /></a>WordPress Time Machine\n<p>Unfortunately, the animations are more distracting than they are useful and add a small delay when viewing images. The full-size images are not large enough and appear blurry when clicked on. If 93Digital removes the animations and uses larger images, the timeline would be a nice way to visually browse through WordPress&#8217; history.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see clear, large images of past WordPress releases and learn about some of the key features in each version, I recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/wordpress-through-the-ages\">WordPress through the ages</a>.

In WordPress 4.4, it switches roles and is an oEmbed provider.</p>\n<p>Proposed by Pascal Birchler <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">earlier this year</a>, oEmbeds for posts streamlines how they&#8217;re shared across the web. Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post looks like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Content is displayed in an iFrame with a link to comments, a sharing button, and a link to the main page the article is hosted on. The continue reading link takes visitors to the source site. In the last three months, Birchler and members of the core team have worked hard to make sure embedded content is secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The iFrames use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes\">sandbox attribute</a> to enable extra restrictions on content that can appear in the inline frame.</li>\n<li>The host and the embedded site communicate via postMessage to allow resizing and clicking on links safely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>oEmbed discovery is turned on by default in WordPress 4.4. Too disable it, you&#8217;ll need install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/\">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. The plugin does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>\n<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>\n<li>Disables all JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/#comment-28263\">are requesting</a> that an option be added to disable oEmbeds rather than installing a plugin. In response to requests, Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, reemphasized <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions\">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> on adding options.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesn’t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right?</p>\n<p>Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end-user has no interest in. It’s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Birchler also responded saying, &#8220;The new embed functionality was developed with the majority of users in mind.&#8221; One of the largest problems with adding to options to WordPress is that they&#8217;re difficult to remove.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress developers are excited to see how post embeds can be extended. <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/\">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who works for Automattic, thinks post embeds will be great for Custom Post Types, &#8220;I think the oEmbed feature has loads of awesome use cases for Custom Post Types. For example, being able to embed eCommerce products on other sites with dynamic add to cart links,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to try post embeds is to log into <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\">TryWPBeta</a> using these credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a new post and make sure the visual editor is selected. Copy a URL from one of the Make Core WordPress blog posts and paste it into the editor.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about how this feature works, check out <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/\">Birchler&#8217;s post</a> where he explains what developers need to take note of and how to customize the output.
